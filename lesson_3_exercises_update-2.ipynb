    "Very often we do not have access to a dataset of all possible outcomes (sample space) that we can query to see how probable different outcomes are (or any set of outcomes, which we called an **event**). This can be because there are far too many outcomes to list them all or because such a detailed data is simply not available. Even if we had this data, querying it every time we wanted to find the probability of some event is not the a very efficient way to get the answer. Instead, we can find the probability associated with each outcome in the sample space once and save it for future reference. This is basically what a probability distribution is: a sort of lookup table that we refer to when we need to find the probability of some event."

    "We will now investigate some basics of probability in a bit more detail.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **discrete distribution** is a probability distribution describing a process with discrete outcomes. By discrete outcomes, we mean outcomes that have specific states which we can count. We have already investigated an example of a discrete process when we examined the outcome of dice throws. Each dice lands with a certain side up and the sum of the two numbers is the total score. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete distribution, the probability of an event, A, is the number of ways A can occur, divided by the number of total possible outcomes in our **sample space**, S. Let's make this concrete with an example. In the figure below there are 10 events in S, 6 in set A, and 4 in set B.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample space](../images/sample-space.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the events in a subset, A, given a set of possible events in the sample space, S, can be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\frac{N(A)}{N(S)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case there are 10 events in S, 6 events in subset A, and 4 in subset B. We can compute the probabilities of A and B like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$\n",
    "$$P(B) = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we are treating events as mathematical sets and applying set operations to define the **intersection** $P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{2}{10}$ and **union** $P(A \\cup B) = \\frac{8}{10}$ of two events $A$ and $B$, as well as the **negation** of event $A$: $P(A') = 1 - P(A) = \\frac{4}{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this basic operations to create more complex operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P((A \\cup B)') = P(A' \\cap B') = P(C) = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any two events $A$ and $B$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(A \\cap B) = 0$ if the two events are **mutually exclusive**, i.e. they can't happen at the same time."

    "As a side note, an alternative to expressing events in terms of probability is using **odds**, which are the ratio of the number of ways an event can occur to the number of ways it can not occur. Sometimes we say that **odds** are the count of events in favor of an event vs. the count against the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you flip a fair coin the odds of getting heads are $1:1$ (1 in 1). Since there are only two possible equally likely outcomes in the coin flip, we say the odds of the outcome are even. As another example, if you roll a single fair dice your odds of rolling a 6 are $1:5$ (1 in 5)."
